## Functionality on `java.lang.Math`

- Some basic math functions are available in `java.lang.Math` class. They are listed below:

  | Method                         | Description                                                                                                                                            |

  | `Math.incrementExact(int x)`   | Returns the argument incremented by one, throwing an exception if the result overflows an int.                                                         |
  | `Math.decrementExact(int x)`   | Returns the argument decremented by one, throwing an exception if the result overflows an int.                                                         |

  | `Math.max(int a, int b)`       | Returns the greater of two int values.                                                                                                                 |
  | `Math.round(float a)`          | Returns the closest int to the argument, with ties rounding to positive infinity.                                                                      |
  | `Math.floor(double a)`         | Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) double value that is less than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.     |
  | `Math.ceil(double a)`          | Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. |
  | `Math.sqrt(double a)`          | Returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value.                                                                                  |
  | `Math.cbrt(double a)`          | Returns the cube root of a double value.                                                                                                               |

  | `Math.random()`                | Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.                                                           |

### Why use `Math.random()` over `Random` class?

- `Math.random()` uses `Random` class internally. It is a static method and it uses `Random` class instance to produce random numbers.
- `Random` class instance is not shared between threads, so it is thread safe. But `Math.random()` is shared between threads, so it is not thread safe.
- `Random` class instance can be used to produce random numbers of different types, but `Math.random()` can only produce `double` type random numbers.

  ```java
  // The below code produces random characters between A-Z
  int random = (int) (Math.random() * (26)) + 65;
  ```

## `BigDecimal` class

- `BigDecimal` class is used for mathematical operations which require precision. It is used when we need more accuracy than `double` datatype.
- `BigDecimal` class is immutable and it provides operations for arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and format conversion.
- The field holds an **unscaled** `BigInteger` value and an **int** value for the **scale**.
- If zero or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. If negative, the unscaled value of the number is multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale. The value of the number represented by the `BigDecimal` is therefore `(unscaledValue Ã— 10^-scale)`.
