- The Dancing Plague of 1518:
In the summer of 1518, in Strasbourg, Alsace (modern-day France), a strange phenomenon occurred known as the
"Dancing Plague." A woman named Frau Troffea began to dance fervently in the streets, and within a week, dozens of
people joined her. The dancing continued to spread, and at its peak, hundreds of people were compelled to dance
uncontrollably for days without rest. Authorities were perplexed, and some even believed it was a curse or divine
punishment. The phenomenon lasted for several weeks, and there are various theories, including mass hysteria,
psychological stress, or poisoning, though the exact cause remains a mystery.

- Tunguska Event (1908):
On June 30, 1908, a massive explosion occurred near the Tunguska River in Siberia, Russia. The explosion, known as the
Tunguska Event, flattened an estimated 80 million trees over an area of 2,150 square kilometers (830 square miles).
Despite the scale of the devastation, there were no known human casualties, primarily because the region was sparsely
populated.
The cause of the explosion has been attributed to the airburst of a meteoroid or comet about 5 to 10 kilometers above
the Earth's surface. The energy released in the explosion was estimated to be equivalent to 10â€“15 megatons of TNT,
making it one of the most powerful natural explosions in recorded history. The lack of a crater and the remote
location added to the mystery surrounding the event, and it has become a subject of scientific study and speculation
over the years.
